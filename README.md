# DataScience-KMC
In this project I have implemented K-Means Clustering on the 'iris' dataset.
The Elbow Method is used to determine the value of k, that is the optimal number of clusters. 
The clustering is done based on the 2 variables: Sepal Width and Sepal Length.
Lastly, the clusters are visually represented along with the cluster centroids.
